# Current Sprint Tasks for GraphRAG Implementation

## GRAG-001: Implement Image Entity Extraction Module
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** None

### Requirements
- Extract textual entities from images using OCR with GPU acceleration.

- Spatial relationships (e.g., "left of", "above") are correctly identified.
- Module gracefully falls back to CPU processing when GPU is unavailable.
- Output is formatted as an `ImageEntities` object.

### Technical Notes
- Use `ImageProcessor` class from `src/extraction/image_processor.py`.

- Return results in a structured `CommunityAnalysis` format.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Results are returned as a `CommunityAnalysis` object with metrics.
- Analysis completes within 5 seconds for a graph of 10,000 nodes.

### Technical Notes
- Use `CuGraphAnalyzer` class from `src/analytics/cugraph_analyzer.py`.
- Configure `ResourceHandle` for memory management.
